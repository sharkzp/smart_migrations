== Project create for helping with writing migrations and auto run them after create.
== TO DO:
* Understand how to wrote generators and make them work on current project
* Pass params throught generators and catch them
* Make migration file by params that we catch(check current version in seeds.rb or make it by ourselfs)
* Run migration
== How it needs to be look like:
** g smigration create_table_users(:name => {:type => 'string', :null => false, :index => true}, :gender => 'boolean')
==  CreateUser: migrating ====================================================
-- create_table(:users)
   -> 0.1125s
-- add_index(:users, :name)
   -> 0.0100s
==  CreateUser: migrated (0.1227s) ===========================================
